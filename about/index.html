  <div id="about">
    <p>Harrison Gill was born and raised in Chicago.</p>
    <p>He's still figuring himself out while, among other curiosities, studying graphic design at Boston University. He loves traveling, modern architecture, <a href="https://a24films.com" target="blank">A24 films</a>, existentialism, Miles Davis, <a href="https://blonded.co" target="blank">Frank Ocean</a>, tasteful streetwear, <a href="http://www.vagabund-moto.at" target="blank">Vagabund Moto</a>, justice, mangos, and dogs. He's a sucker for dense cities who yet eventually wants a farm with his family in the Alps of Switzerland, to which he's never even been.</p>
